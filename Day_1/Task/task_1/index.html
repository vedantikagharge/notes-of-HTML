<b style="color:red" >A. P. J. Abdul Kalam (1931-2015)</b>, known as the "Missile Man of India," was a renowned aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India (2002-2007). Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam came from a humble background, but his deep curiosity and love for learning led him to excel in science and technology. 

    He earned a degree in physics from St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, and later studied aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT). Kalam joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he contributed to India's civilian space program and military missile development. He played a pivotal role in developing the country's ballistic missile and satellite launch vehicle technology, which earned him the title of "Missile Man." Notably, he was a key figure in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which established India as a nuclear power.
    
    Kalam was admired for his simplicity, humility, and dedication to education. After his presidency, he became a beloved figure among the youth, inspiring millions with his vision of India as a developed nation by 2020. He wrote several books, including "Wings of Fire," his autobiography, and "Ignited Minds," which reflected his dream of empowering the younger generation.
    
    On July 27, 2015, Kalam passed away while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management, Shillong. His life and work continue to inspire generations to dream big and serve the nation selflessly.

    <b style="color:red">Early Influences and Education:</b>
    A. P. J. Abdul Kalam's early life was shaped by his upbringing in a modest household in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. His father, Jainulabdeen, was a boat owner and an imam of a local mosque, while his mother, Ashiamma, was a devout and caring homemaker. Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, and the family faced financial challenges, but his parents instilled in him the values of discipline, integrity, and hard work.
    
    As a child, Kalam was known for his curiosity and love of reading. He would rise early to help his family by distributing newspapers, and he used this opportunity to broaden his knowledge by reading as much as he could. His early schooling took place at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School in Ramanathapuram, where his teachers recognized his potential and encouraged his interest in mathematics and science.
    
    After completing his secondary education, Kalam attended St. Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli, where he graduated with a degree in physics. His passion for flight and aeronautics then led him to the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT), where he studied aerospace engineering. It was here that Kalam's career trajectory was set—he was determined to work in the field of aviation and contribute to India's development in aeronautics and space.
